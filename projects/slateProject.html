        <h1>Slate</h1>

        <p> Slate was one of the most project that I have ever done.
            It required months of research, along with hours of painstaking time
            throughout the process of the project. There were 3 main steps to Slate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            First there were a lot of research that needed to be completed in order to ensure that this could be
            completed. First of all, I needed to look into Tensorflow and figure out how their CNN
            (Conventional Neural Network) libraries worked. This involved researching how CNNs worked in general.
            I was able to get a lot of good work out of training these models. Below is the graphs of validation...

            I tested this using the <a
                href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T">HAM10000</a>
            dataset (huge thanks to them for providing
            such an easy to access database) and trying to prove my algorithm on those 10000 images. Currently working
            towards diversifying
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, all I needed to do was to create the application. I was working on Flutter beforehand, so this was
            pretty easy.
            However I had to get off the emulator and pull out a phone in order to fully test the camera side of the
            application. All that's left is to
            integrate the two halves, which means I'll probably need to get another phone, since the one I was using
            didn't have the required
            AndroidSDK. Below You can see the plans and scaffolding, and eventually the emulator screenshot
