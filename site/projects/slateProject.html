<h1>Slate</h1>

<p> Slate was one of the most project that I have ever done. 
    It required months of research, along with hours of painstaking time
    throughout the process of the project. There were 3 main steps to Slate.

    First there were a lot of research that needed to be completed in order to ensure that this could be
    completed. First of all, I needed to look into Tensorflow and figure out how their CNN 
    (Conventional Neural Network) libraries worked. This involved researching how CNNs worked in general.
    I was able to get a lot of good work out of training these models. Below is the graphs of validation...

    I tested this using the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T">HAM10000</a> dataset (huge thanks to them for providing 
    such an easy to access database) and tyring to prove my algorithm on those 10000 images. Currently working towards diversifying

    Lastly, all I needed to do was to create the application. I was working on Flutter beforehand, so this was pretty easy. 
    However I had to get off the emulator and pull out a phone in order to fully test the camera side of the application. All that's left is to 
    integrate the two halves, which means I'll probably need to get another phone, since the one I was using didn't have the required
    AndroidSDK
